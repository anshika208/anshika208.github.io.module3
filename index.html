           <p id="chicken">Okay not that we've completed our menu categories page. Let's take a look at the mock up as to what would happen if the user clicked in one of these menu categories in the menu categories page. Well what would happen is that they would go to that single category page that would have all the menu items. That this category contains. Let's go to the single category page and take a look here. So we have the name of the category up front. Maybe some information underneath. And every single item here in that particular category. Notice that the layout here is one menu item followed by another menu item on the same line and then it keeps repeating over and over. Which means this is probably going to be a bootstrap grid and we're going to divide this six in six columns. So it'll divide the width of the browser nicely. Now also notice that we have yet another grid within individual cells. So here you can see that there's about half and half again. But I would say that maybe this is a little smaller, so maybe five and seven. So basically, this is going to be one cell of the grid and this is also going to be one cell of the grid. This one is probably going to take about five columns, and this one is probably going to take about seven columns. So we have a grid within the bigger grid that contains six and six columns. Okay, so let's go back to our code editor. Well, let's first actually take a look at our main categories page. And if we click on this, this will go as you can see, to a single category. And right now, we don't have a single category at HTML, which is fine. There's actually that I noticed right now it would be nice to give some sort of education to the user that we're sitting on the menu page all ready. Right now it just looks like we're again kind of in the nowhere land. So the way we could do that is by going to our menus categories page. And I'm right now in menus categories.html. Which is located in examples, Lecture 38 after folder, and I can find my menu item right here. I should actually make it capital Menu right here, and this is that menu item, that navigational menu item. Well the way to make this stand out Is to give it a class of active. And that's a bootstrap class. And I believe we might have actually overridden this class or at least overridden some of the properties in this class to match kind of the hover over effect. So let' s go back to our browser. It has a nice indication that we're sitting on the menu page. And it's the same time of background that we get and have over of other pages. Okay, so that's good. So let's go back to our code editor and copy the menu categories page because all the pages is going to be again the same except for the main content. So if we scroll down, let's close up this menu, the images. Let's go to the menu categories page and what we'll do is we'll click duplicate, and we'll change that to single category. Single category. Okay, so now it's a single category. Okay, so now what we need to do is we need to clear out all the menu categories related content out of this so we have a clean slate to start with. So we'll probably need to get to main content right here. So we'll go all the way here and find where the main content ends.

Right there. That's easy to see. And we'll erase all that. So here's our clean slate that we can start coding. Let's go back to the browser and take a look as to what happens now. If I click on one of the menu categories, it should go to single category.html and sure enough, it does accept of course, there's no content here in the middle. So let's go back to the code editor and start coding up our content. So the first thing we need to do is give our page some sort of a heading. So the way we're going to do that is by havi</p>
